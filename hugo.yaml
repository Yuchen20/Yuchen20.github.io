    Content: "Hey, this is Yuchen, a self-motivated student trying to get into a phd program by 2025. Personally, I am interested in computer vision and efficient AI (partly due to my lack of GPU :smiling_face_with_tear:). This blog is mostly used as a place to document all my readings. Hopefully, you will enjoy this blog :)"
