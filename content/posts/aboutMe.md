I am a master's student pursuing an MPhil in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge. My interests lie in computer vision, machine learning, and, particularly, in building efficient deep learning models. Previously, I studied Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. ChengJia Wang](https://chengjiawang.github.io/) on medical-related deep learning methods.

In my free time, I enjoy competing on Kaggle, reading Chinese fiction novels, and sometimes reading interesting papers on arXiv.
